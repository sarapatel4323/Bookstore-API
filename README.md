# Bookstore API

This is a small bookstore API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (using Mongoose). It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete books and users.

## Project Overview

The Bookstore API allows for managing a collection of books and users. It supports basic CRUD operations, such as creating new book entries, fetching a list of books or a specific book, updating book details, and deleting books. Similar CRUD functionality is available for user management.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server-side.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing book and user data.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.


Replace `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your MongoDB connection string.


## Folder Structure

- **middleware/**: Custom middleware functions.
- **models/**: Mongoose schemas and models for books and users.
- **router/**: Route handlers for books and users.
- **views/**: (Optional) For any view templates, if needed.
- **index.js**: Main entry point of the application.
